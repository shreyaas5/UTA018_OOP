//Write the class definition for a Date class that contains three private integer data members:
// month, day, and year. Create a static member to hold a slash. Create two public member
// functions, setDate() and showDate(). You will use the static slash in the showDate() function.
// The setDate()function accepts three integer arguments and passes them on to three private
// functions, setMonth(), setDay(), and setYear(). If a month is greater than 12, then set it to 12.
// If a day is greater than 31, then set it to 31. Write a main()function that instantiates several
// objects of the Date class and tests the member functions.
